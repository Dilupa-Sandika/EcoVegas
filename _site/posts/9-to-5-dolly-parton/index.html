            <h2>About the Song</h2>
<p>Written and recorded for the 1980 comedy film of the same name, Dolly Parton's '9 to 5' became an instant anthem for office workers everywhere. The song's upbeat tempo contrasts with its lyrics, which detail the daily grind and frustrations of the working class, particularly women facing an unappreciative boss. It resonated deeply with audiences, topping multiple charts and earning numerous accolades, solidifying its place as a classic protest song wrapped in a joyful country-pop package.</p>
<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5</p>
<p>Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it</p>
<p>9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me</p>
<p>They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way</p>
<p>Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it</p>
<p>9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet</p>
<p>9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5!</p>
