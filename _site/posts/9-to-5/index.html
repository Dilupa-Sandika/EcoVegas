            <p>Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life</p>
<p>Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5</p>
<p>Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it</p>
<p>9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me</p>
<p>They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way</p>
<p>Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it</p>
<p>9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his pocket</p>
<p>Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it</p>
<p>9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it

<p>Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy
It's enough to drive you crazy
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it</p>

        <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert">
            <p>Released in 1980, &quot;9 to 5&quot; is an iconic anthem written and performed by Dolly Parton for the comedy film of the same name. The song masterfully blends an upbeat, catchy country-pop melody with lyrics that voice the frustrations and aspirations of office workers, particularly women, facing inequality and drudgery in the workplace. It became a massive international hit and a rallying cry for workers everywhere, solidifying its place in pop culture history.</p>
