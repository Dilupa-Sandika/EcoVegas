<h2>ගීතය ගැන කෙටි හැඳින්වීමක්</h2>
<p>Inspired by William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet', Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' reimagines the classic tragedy with a triumphant, happy ending. Written from the perspective of Juliet, the song narrates a tale of forbidden love that ultimately receives a father's blessing. It became a global phenomenon, marking her transition from a country artist to a mainstream pop superstar.</p>
<h2>පද රචනය</h2>
<p>(Verse 1)
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air</p>
<p>... (ඉතුරු lyrics ටික) ...</p>
