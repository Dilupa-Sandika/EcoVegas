            <p>(Verse 1)
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air</p>
<p>See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, &quot;Hello&quot;
Little did I know</p>
<p>That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, &quot;Stay away from Juliet&quot;
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, &quot;Please don't go,&quot; and I said</p>
<p>Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p>So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh</p>
<p>'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, &quot;Stay away from Juliet&quot;
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, &quot;Please don't go,&quot; and I said</p>
<p>Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p>Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, oh</p>
<p>I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fadin'
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said</p>
<p>Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said</p>
<p>&quot;Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you</p>

        <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert">
            <p>Inspired by William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet', Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' reimagines the classic tragedy with a triumphant, happy ending.</p>
<p>Written from the perspective of Juliet, the song narrates a tale of forbidden love that ultimately receives a father's blessing. It became a global phenomenon, marking her transition from a country artist to a mainstream pop superstar.</p>
